    <h1>The Best Movies According to Thee-Vitruvian</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Shrek</h3>
    <p>This by far is the best animation from way back when. The story-line is quite relatable.</p>
    <h3>Deadpool</h3>
    <p>If you are a fun of a mix of fiction and laughter then this is the movie for you. New realise coming up for 2024.</p>
    <h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
    <p>Jim Carrey plays the best role here. This will crack you up for sure. Very funny and stupid.</p>
